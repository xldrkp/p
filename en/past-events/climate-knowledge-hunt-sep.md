## Summary

IPCC/AR6/WG3 (Climate Change and Mitigations) was published in 2022-April. We had a group of volunteers and interns at NIPGR in place and switched our emphasis to making a semantic version incorporating our Open ideas, code, material and protocols. We were invited to submit a project for the UN-University-of-Geneva Piaget Hackathon in 2022-June which was won by our group of young interns led by Shweata N Hegde (Mysuru). 
 
We intend to develop this as a flexible, extensible series of re-usable workshops ("Learning by Doing"), and Saturday 2022-09-24 was therefore the first time we released the system for use outside the group!

The "hack" set out to answer many questions:
* is #semanticClimate knowledge likely to be useful?
* can citizens from a wide range of backgrounds (policy makers, libraries, researchers, coders, climate specialists, etc.) understand and use it?
* what are the most useful future directions? Can it be extended?
* does LearningByDoing work for the participants?
* who else should the group link up with, politically and technically?
* does the workshop/hack format (in-depth instructions and guided hands-on) work? 
* did the technology work?

Some objective findings:
* About 75 people registered which delighted us. 
* We committed to going at a pace where everyone got a chance to "press the buttons".
* We wanted to show the delegates the great interest and support from policy makers and funders (Principal Scientific Adviser GoI, UNDP, Delhi Knowledge Cluster, etc.)
