#semanticClimate participated in [Piaget Hackathon](https://hackathon-piaget.sparkboard.com/public) hosted at Geneva. The team worked towards developing a multilingual learning module in Google Colab. The module was aimed at academicians, teachers, etc. who want to use TDM tools to extract useful information out of jargon-filled deluge of reports that often come as PDFs. 

The team won the hackathon and is now being supported by SDG Accelerator to develop carpentery-style hackathons to showcase the tools.
